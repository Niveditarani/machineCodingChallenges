In this #machineCodingChallenge - First challenge is to create an Employee Database management app.

###__**Frontend Technologies:**__

HTML5 | CSS3 |Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)


###🚀 __**What This Project Does**__

🧑 Displays a list of employees dynamically

➕ Allows adding a new employee with name, role, salary, email, and date of joining

🖼️ Supports image upload (with fallback icon if none provided)

✏️ Enables editing employee info

❌ Supports deletion with confirmation

💾 Saves all changes persistently using localStorage

🔁 Uses data.json as fallback when localStorage is empty


###📚 __**JavaScript Fundamentals Used**__

✅ __**Core Concepts:**__

IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)-	Encapsulates logic to avoid polluting global scope

DOM Manipulation-	Dynamic creation and rendering of employee cards

Event Delegation-	Efficient click and submit handling on parent elements

FormData API-	Extracts input data including uploaded files

FileReader API-	Converts images to base64 format

Async/Await-	Handles asynchronous data fetching and file reading

Object Destructuring / Spread-	Used for updating employee data immutable

Template Literals-	Used for building dynamic HTML strings

Local Storage-	Saves and retrieves data for persistence

Data Validation-	Validates email, salary, and name before saving



###__**Level: Intermediate JavaScript**__

This project covers intermediate JS concepts, ideal for those who:
Know basic JS and want to deepen DOM handling
Want to build something closer to a real application
Are preparing for frontend interviews or machine coding rounds
