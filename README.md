In this #machineCodingChallenge - First challenge is to create an Employee Database management app.

🚀 What This Project Does
🧑 Displays a list of employees dynamically

➕ Allows adding a new employee with name, role, salary, email, and date of joining

🖼️ Supports image upload (with fallback icon if none provided)

✏️ Enables editing employee info

❌ Supports deletion with confirmation

💾 Saves all changes persistently using localStorage

🔁 Uses data.json as fallback when localStorage is empty

📚 JavaScript Fundamentals Used

✅ Core Concepts:
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)-	Encapsulates logic to avoid polluting global scope
DOM Manipulation-	Dynamic creation and rendering of employee cards
Event Delegation-	Efficient click and submit handling on parent elements
FormData API-	Extracts input data including uploaded files
FileReader API-	Converts images to base64 format
Async/Await-	Handles asynchronous data fetching and file reading
Object Destructuring / Spread-	Used for updating employee data immutably
Template Literals-	Used for building dynamic HTML strings
Local Storage-	Saves and retrieves data for persistence
Data Validation-	Validates email, salary, and name before saving

Frontend Technologies:

HTML5 | CSS3 |Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Level: Intermediate JavaScript

This project covers intermediate JS concepts, ideal for those who:

Know basic JS and want to deepen DOM handling

Want to build something closer to a real application

Are preparing for frontend interviews or machine coding rounds
